## Hello. This is a simple task manager.
I implemented a task manager that can help you keep your tasks, delete some and even see the saved tasks.
The tasks are saved in a file so that they don't disappear after the user closes the program.

## How it was iplemented
It is fully implemented in C++. For the time being it only works in the Terminal. But there will be an app version done with Qt in the near future.

## Just give it a try
Hope you enjoy!
